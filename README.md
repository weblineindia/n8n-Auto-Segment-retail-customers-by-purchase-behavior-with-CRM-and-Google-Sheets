# (Retail Automation) Auto-Segment Customers by Purchase Behavior

This workflow automatically segments customers based on their purchase behavior whenever a new order or customer update event is received from platforms like WooCommerce, Shopify, or a CRM. It classifies customers into meaningful segments such as new customers, repeat customers, VIP customers, or inactive customers, syncs these segment tags to a CRM or email platform and logs each segmentation event in Google Sheets for tracking and auditing.

### Quick Implementation Steps

1. Import the workflow JSON into n8n.
2. Configure the Webhook URL in your eCommerce platform or CRM.
3. Review and adjust segmentation rules if needed.
4. Configure the CRM API endpoint and Google Sheets credentials.
5. Activate the workflow and test with sample events.


## What It Does

This workflow listens for customer-related events such as order creation or customer updates via a webhook. Incoming payloads are normalized to extract essential customer and behavioral data, including order count, lifetime spend, last order date, product categories and source system.

Using rule-based logic, the workflow evaluates customer behavior and assigns an appropriate segment tag. Customers are classified into segments such as new customers, repeat customers, VIP customers, or inactive customers based on purchase frequency, total spend and recency of activity.

Once a segment is determined, the workflow syncs the assigned segment tag to a CRM or email marketing platform and logs the segmentation event in Google Sheets. This ensures clean customer segmentation, consistent tagging and visibility for reporting and audits.


## Who’s It For

This workflow is ideal for:
- E-commerce businesses using WooCommerce or Shopify
- Marketing teams running targeted email campaigns
- CRM administrators managing customer segmentation
- Growth and retention teams analyzing customer behavior
- Operations teams maintaining clean customer data


## Prerequisites

To use this workflow, you need:
- An active n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- A source system that can send webhook events (WooCommerce, Shopify, or CRM)
- Customer and order data including order count, lifetime spend and last order date
- Access to a CRM or email platform API
- Google Sheets API access and a prepared spreadsheet


## How to Use & Setup

1. Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance.
2. Configure **Receive Customer Order or Update Event** with your webhook path.
3. Ensure your source system sends required fields such as customer stats and order details.
4. Review **Normalize Customer Purchase Data** to verify field mappings.
5. Adjust segmentation thresholds in **Determine Customer Segment** if needed.
6. Configure **Sync Customer Segment to CRM** with your actual CRM API endpoint and authentication.
7. Connect Google Sheets and ensure required columns exist.
8. Activate the workflow and test with sample payloads.


## How To Customize Nodes

- **Normalize Customer Purchase Data**
  - Add or remove customer or order attributes.
- **Determine Customer Segment**
  - Modify rules for VIP, new, repeat, or inactive customers.
  - Adjust thresholds like lifetime spend or inactivity duration.
- **Assign Segment Nodes**
  - Change segment tag naming conventions.
- **CRM Sync Node**
  - Map segment tags to different CRM fields or formats.
- **Google Sheets Logging**
  - Add more columns such as order value or product categories.


## Add-ons (Optional Enhancements)

This workflow can be extended to:
- Add category-based customer segments
- Trigger automated email campaigns based on segment
- Prevent duplicate CRM updates
- Add churn prediction or loyalty scoring
- Send Slack alerts for VIP or inactive customers
- Generate weekly or monthly segmentation reports


## Use Case Examples

1. Automatically tagging first-time buyers for onboarding campaigns.
2. Identifying VIP customers based on lifetime spend.
3. Segmenting repeat buyers for loyalty offers.
4. Detecting inactive customers for reactivation campaigns.
5. Keeping CRM customer segments always up to date.

There can be many more use cases depending on business needs.
